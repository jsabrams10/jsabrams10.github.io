All of this code was originally provided by Jason Downing (https://github.com/JasonD94/). I forked his repository, and have customized his code in order to learn more about CSS/HTML and fit my needs. Below is a snippet from his original "README.md":

Built using:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[HTML5](https://developers.google.com/web/)  
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for CSS  
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for JS  
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting  
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for the SSL cert and fancy green lock :lock:  
[git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control

Based on the
[Creative Bootstrap theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/)
from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
The theme is also MIT Licensed.

##### NOTE:

I have a custom domain connected to GitHub, so my GitHub Pages repositories 
do not follow the usual GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME-HERE format. 
Instead they follow a "downing.io/REPOSITORY-NAME-HERE" format. 
If the domain fails for some reason, you can still access my site by going to
